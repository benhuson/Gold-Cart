== Notes ==


If your Gold Cart Name and API Key is not working there are a number of things to check. Here are some common things to look out for.


- If your Name and API Key does not activate, please click Reset API Key then submit your Name and API Key again


- The API Name should not have any space in it, the same goes for your API Key


- If you have checked both if these conditions and your API Key still won't work please ensure your server supports cURL or fsockopen. Your hosting provider needs to allow these protocols for your website to validate the Gold Cart Name and API Key. WordPress also uses fsockopen to activate Akismet spam protection therefore if Akismet works so should WP eCommerce. If you don't know what this means contact your hosting provider or server administrator


- Your firewall may be blocking outgoing connections, ensure the WPeCommerce.org IP address - 198.206.133.81 - is added to your firewall's whitelist/allowed list


- Your Gold Cart files are in the wrong place. The Gold Cart Plugin needs to be unpacked and uploaded into the /wp-content/plugins/ directory


- You have not uploaded all the files correctly. Ensure no files were corrupted or missing during transfer, if in doubt, try uploading the Gold Cart Plugin again
